#Neutrino Score Mechanics - Ideas

- 'Push scrolling' - player moving past certain point on the screen speeds up level scrolling, also adds a multiplier to the score. 
- 'Proximity Multipluer' - closer the player is to the enemy when shooting, the higher the multiplier
- 'Chaining' - 1 hit per bullet? Missing with any bullet drops the chain? Does this need capping?
- 'XP' - Every chain gives XP, XP levels up guns?
- 'P Badges' - Similar to the chain, collecting these levels up the gun, if gun is at max, P Badge gives points
- 'Smart Bombs' - use of smart bomb drops current chain and multiplier, but clears screen. Could be useful if attached to max multiplier? So, get certain chain number, max out, use smart bomb?
- 'Hidden Collectables' - Similar to Dodonpachi, do something, or shoot something on the level to find the secret. Should probably make them ducks :D

# To Support:

- Time Trial: this becomes interesting with the push scroll mechanic above
- Invulnerable mode: essentially a practice mode. Allow for everything except achievements. Have a leaderboard for invulnerable mode. 
- Leaderboards: Steam etc.
